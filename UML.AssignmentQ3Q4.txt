Q3. 
-Program1 leaves their instance variable as public, therefore users have direct access to the variable.
-Tight coupling because Class B has direct access to Class A instance variable.

-Program2 leaves their instance variable as private, therefore users have to access the method in order to access the instance variable.
Encapsulation says we must leave our instance variables private.
-Loose coupling because Class B does not have direct access to Class A instance variable.

Q4.
Program3 is bad programming because of the low cohesion. Unrelated functions are in the same class as related functions.
In order to make it better programming, you need to create a high cohesion setup.Unrelated functions and related functions are in
seperate classes. This will make for better maintenance, usability and easier readabilty.
